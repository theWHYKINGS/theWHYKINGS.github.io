"""unpack_images.py — decode a wk_images.json bundle (pulled from Claude Design
via the browser) into the repo's assets/ and uploads/ folders.

The current Claude Design export references images by relative path instead of
inlining them, so the referenced image files must be hosted alongside the HTML.
Claude fetches them in the browser into a single JSON bundle (path -> base64);
this script writes them to disk. Re-run whenever the image set changes.
